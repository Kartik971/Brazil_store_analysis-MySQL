### Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze sales data from a Brazilian store. The data is large and required preprocessing before it could be imported into MySQL for analysis.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
  The raw data encountered import errors when directly loaded into MySQL due to its size and format. To address this, the following steps were taken:
   1) Data Cleaning with Python: Python's pandas library was used to clean and preprocess the data. This involved handling missing values, correcting data types, and creating tuples for 
      insertion into MySQL.
   2) Data Insertion into MySQL: The cleaned data was then inserted into MySQL tables in a structured format.

### DataBase Schema
The MySQL database schema includes the following tables:

* orders
* products
* customers
* reviews
* sellers
* orderitems
* order_payments

### Data Analysis
 The analysis focused on:

* Geographical Analysis
* Payment Analysis
* Top Cities and Products
